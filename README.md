# FIRM
#Foraminiferal Isotope Reproduciblity Model

Citations for this model should refer to Fraass & Lowery (Submitted to Paleoceanography)

Everything in this repository is written in R. Users must run the FIRM Setup.R file prior to using FIRM. FIRM Setup.R will install the neccesary dataset onto the users machine, as well as the packages used to decompose that datafile.
The second file contains the code for the model itself. All the modifiable parameters (e.g., diagenesis) are nearer the top of the model. 

We (Chris and I) welcome both collaboration on the further development of this model, or simply taking it and building on it yourself. If you choose to do that, however, we /beg/ you to cite our orginal paper (Fraass & Lowery, submitted to Paleoceanography). Gotta to get a job somehow, after all.
